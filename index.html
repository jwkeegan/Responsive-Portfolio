                Hi everyone, my name is Joe Keegan!
                I'm from Eagan, Minnesota, and went to school at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
                My undergraduate degree was in Engineering Mechanics, but after some time in the field, I'd like a change of scenery.
                I minored in Computer Science, so I have a little background in coding, but am new to web development.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of class, my hobbies include golfing, skiing, and playing video games.
                I enjoy watching most sports: I'm a huge fan of all Minnesota professional teams and the Badgers.
                Additionally, I like to travel whenever possible, and I like to try out local breweries when I do.
            </p>
